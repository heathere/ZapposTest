In creating a zoo for at least 2 dragons that keeps them safe and healthy AND keeps the customers alive, there are many things to consider. 

First: EDUCATION - research dragons (Generate a list of initial questions. Find the answers. Generate a list of additional questions resulting from research.) *General familiarity with the subject is essential*
  > Do they fight or get along with one another? 
  > What do they eat? 
  > What causes them to breathe fire? 
  > How much room do they need to fly? 
  > Is there a nest in their cave? 
  > How many babies do they have and how often? 
  > In what ways can customers harm them?
  > Other than the fire, how can they harm people? Do they eat people? 
  > Scales – isn’t there something special about dragon scales?
  > Grooming?

Second: ASSESSMENT - determine the parameters of health and safety  *What is needed?*
  > Dangers to dragons
  > Dangers to customers
  > Needs for vitality (both dragons and customers)

Third: SOLUTIONS - weigh pros and cons of potential solutions *No solutions is perfect so figure out which one is best?*
  > Barriers – fence, wall, glass, diamond?
